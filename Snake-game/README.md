Your character, the snake, is the green dot. Your objective is to each the apples,
which are the red dots. You move using the arrows keys. Your score is in the
upper left corner of the screen, and represents how many apples you have eaten
in this round.

As you eat more apples your snake gets longer and longer, making it more difficult
to navigate around the game area. If you eat yourself or eat a wall you will get
a game over screen, and your round is over.

Once you get a game over you can play again, quit entirely, or go back to the
home screen.
